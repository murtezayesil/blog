    <summary> Why use <b>mdBook</b>, an online book creation tool, while there are CMSs that specializes on Blogging ? </summary>
    <p>
        1. CMSs are overkill for my needs
    </p>
    <p>
        2. I don't want to run a software that will require updating time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. I <b>feel</b> like CMSs are vendor locking in some way. Many of them require creating account to use their tools. I am not saying that is not fair, it is their platform after all. I don't want one more online account for something I don't need.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. CMSs usually embed "innocent" trackers to count visits. I don't care about how many people read my articles. I would rather have meaningful conversation in social media than seeing visitor numbers go up.
