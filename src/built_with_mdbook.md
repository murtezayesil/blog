# Built with mdBook

This blog was built using mdBook, an online documentation book building tool.

Why do you use a documentation building tool to build a blog?
Well, there are 3 main reasons:
1. Past Experience: I wrote markdown (md) files in the past and they are super easy get use to. But I don't have much experience on HTML/CSS/JS 
2. Ease of use: I can easily write and publish the blog without a CMS, content management system such as WordPress or Joomla, thanks to these open-source tools. It is not that CMSs are bloated or anything. Infact I know that [Kev Quirk](kevq.uk) uses WordPress for his blog and it is freaking fast.
3. All I need is present out-of-the-box: mdBook generates with a beatiful yet minimal layout that I like.

  <summary>I wrote MarkDown files in the past</summary>
    but I don't have much experience with <i>HTML</i>,<i>CSS</i> and <i>JavaScript</i>.
    <br/>
    <tab/>I can cover shortcomings of MarkDown with HTML since many HTML tags are supported in MarkDown.
    <br/>
    I thought to myself "Why bother while I can write in MarkDown and let tools do the rest."

  <summary>Not dependent to a CMS</summary>
  ## No middle man such as *WordPress*, *Joomla* or *write.as*.
  #### I am not saying that they are bloated and should be avoided. Infact I know [Kev Quirk](kevq.uk) uses WordPress for his blog and it is freaking fast.

Whenever <i>MarkDown</i> is not enough, I can use <b>HTML tags</b> too.
