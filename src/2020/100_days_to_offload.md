# \#100DaysToOffload

I‚Äôm publishing this as part of 100 Days To Offload. You can join in yourself by visiting https://100daystooffload.com  

Legend says that it is better to write 100 posts for 100 consecutive days. But these are guidelines, not strict rules. If they were, I wouldn't even start. Instead I will update this post regularly. I am not writing 100 separate posts because it feels like spamming my own blog.

##### Day 1/100

1. Yay üòÉÔ∏è I finally took on the challenge  

2. Today I went to GitHub to delete many repositories I forked and abandoned over the years. One of them was my i3wm config repository. I don't worry about losing my i3 config really. What I wanted to salvage from it was my tty-clock like wallpaper generator script.
   
   Old script didn't use variables and was hard to modify. I started rewriting it today. It was a challenge to write it back in the day and it is a challenge to rewrite it again. I am learning many things about bash while trying though. Bash scripting can be mind tickling. This is why it is fun.

3. I purchased hosting on Digital Ocean and deployed my OwnCloud instance. Some people wonder why I choosed OwnCloud over NextCloud. OwnCloud makes better pun.

2. I will setup SMTP for OwnCloud to send emails to its users. I am just happy that it will be more practice for me.
