# \#100DaysToOffload

I’m publishing this as part of 100 Days To Offload. You can join in yourself by visiting https://100daystooffload.com  

Legend says that it is better to write 100 posts for 100 consecutive days. But these are guidelines, not strict rules. If they were, I wouldn't even start. Instead I will update this post regularly. I am not writing 100 separate posts because it feels like spamming my own blog.
