# I want to blog

I was the introvert boy in elementary and middle school. I was aware that I didn't like being surrounded by many people. My birthdays were me, my family and grandparents sometimes. It was always quiet and peaceful times for me.

I believe there was a part of me that wanted to talk but also didn't want to be heard by strangers. Around that time [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) got popular in Turkey and was acquired by Google. It was (and still is) free to launch a page under a subdomain of blogspot.com . So, I created an account and created 2 sites. Never posted anything. Then Facebook became popular and as the popular quiet kid of the school I had to create an account. I "friended" my classmates which I believed was a compulsive rule that everybody had to follow. I rapidly got overwhelmed with constant flow of status updates. I didn't sign in for years.

I became more of an ambivert type after my family and I moved to Kenya where I learned English language while continuing high school. Well, I repeated 1 year of high school becuase I didn't know any grammar when we moved. I was able to communicate easily but slowly after 6 months.

I got a better picture of vastness of the Internet after start googling in Enlish. I came across many blogs about tech since I was always inclined towards it. One of the blogs I read regularly was [OMG! Ubuntu!](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/) <img title="" src="https://fosstodon.b-cdn.net/custom_emojis/images/000/010/369/static/ubuntu.png" alt="Ubuntu Emoji from FOSStodon" width="16">. By time I start to want to have a blog of my own. I didn't know what to write but why not, right! But I dind't know how to do it.

Do you remember [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/). Yeah, I made few attempts there as a kid (around 2007, I guess). It felt cluttered, I didn't have anything to say, I was an introverted kid who couldn't get it going.  
    Anyway, It is 2020. I got wiser, older, more social and few things to say. Thus blog.

❕️Audience of this blog is me. Therefore don't mind me talking to a hypothetical Murteza.

## Why is it so simple looking?

This blog features:

- **No advertisement**  
   Because this is not a place for it.
- **No trackers**  
   I can't get a record of which articles you read.  
   I can't know how many people visited my blog.  
- **No comments**  
   Only way to "_comment_" to my articles is to send a message to my [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@murteza_y) or [FOSStodon](https://fosstodon.org/@murtezayesil) accounts.
- **Ease on eyes, not busy**  
   I can't handle too many things happening simultaneously, how can I expect you can.
- **A blog and a landing-page**  
   It was never meant to be more.

## Tehnical Part

Every webpage on the internet needs few things to be exist:

- URL

## For how long have you been doing web development?

I learned some HTML4 in ICT class but it was limited to headers, paragraphs, tables and images. Just enough for IGCSE examination.  
I used mdBook which I got to know from Rust's "The Book". I like the look of The Book and wanted to use mdBook so that I wouldn't need to dive into CSS and JS. But I still asked for advice on FOSStodon even though I didn't exactly follow them. I got so many replies which really suprised me since I don't have many followers, not to mention, some of them are bots. I am very thankful for community's help. I tooted few questions and they shared their knowledge with me.  
Their help is not for nothing. My toot is pinned and people can see it for referensing in the future.

A special thanks to [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk) and [Mike Stone](https://mikestone.me). I wouldn't get the help I needed if they weren't hosting FOSStodon.
