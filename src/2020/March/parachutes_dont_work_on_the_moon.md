# Parachutes don't work on The Moon

I grew up in Turkey. Studied elementary, middle and first half of high school in its terrible horrible all theory no practice system. I hated school but not my teachers. They were adding practice sessions whenever they could find time from trowing theories at us.

My family and I moved to Kenya after I completed grade 10 in Turkey with half a mind. I could remember very few words such as apple, banana, water, school, test, I, am/is/are, new, student, you, he/she/it, we, they, small etc...  
I repeated 10th grade but in IGCSE system this time. Because I had to learn English language first since I didn't have English skill good enough for anything.
It started with constructing a defense answer just in case human interaction got initiated. It was "I am new student. I know small English". This sentence is the reason my classmates became my English teachers. 
My classmate corrected me countless times.  

| So that I would say   | instead of            |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| I know little Egnlish | I know small English  |
| Do you have lead      | Have you lead         |
| What does ... mean    | What ... mean         |
| Ins't it              | Is what I say correct |

In other words, I learned the meanings of the words from my classmates in Kenya instead of memorizing some syntax. I got comfortable enough to chat with my friends within 6 months and understand my teachers and lessons within 8 months. I was finally good enough to annoy my father by correcting him while he was having a phone call.  

I later went to Turkey for university. Due to political instability of Turkey, my parents wanted me to leave Turkey and study somewhere else. Second affordable enough option was India and that is where I went for 





I feel annoyed and frustrated whenever I remember the education system I studied in elementary and middle schools. It was too heavy with theory and lacking in practice that I hüò°Ô∏èaü§ÆÔ∏ètüòµÔ∏èeüòìÔ∏èd it. I didn't hate my teachers though. They and my parents are the reason I made it through (alive).  

**If theory was food, practice would be chewing. Without practice, theory is just a stomac ache. But when practiced, theory becomes digestable**

Neither my teachers nor parents could prevent the weak foundation I was building without knowing. Theory without practice is like bringing water, cement powder and dirt together and not mixing them together. It is true that you have the ingredients but having ingredients isn't enough.  

**If theory is spirit, practise is the body**

Later, my family and I moved to Kenya. I learned English language and studied high school there, [IGCSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education "International General Certificate of Secondary Education") to be more specific.  

**Without practice, theory is just a theory**

I loved IGCSE because every theory was also supplied with multiple proofs or experiments. We conducted experiments even if they were answering as simple questions as "At what temperature does water boil?". Such simple experiments got us comfortable to work with laboratory equipment and prepared us to final exam.  

I still remember AS level physics exam. Exam started with us set up support stands and lab clamps provided to us. I measured length of threads, cut according to question and attached them to the clamps. I also measured weight of loads and attach them to other end of the thread. After setting load some¬∞ away from the rest position, I let it swing while recording time taken for 10 oscilations using my chronometer. This experiment we conducted for the exam proved that gravity doesn't pull heavier objects faster. Regardless of the length of the thread, lighter and heavier loads took the same amount of time to complete 10 oscilations, there was some margin for error but it was around 1-2% which is fair given how fast we had to setup our experiment stand and the good kind of stress we had during the exam.  

**Practice is the effort to turn knowledge into known**  

Anyway, my father was a new businessman in Kenya and universities in Kenya were too expensive for us. Studying abroad wasn't an appealing option for the most part either, especially after adding the cost of living as well. Turkey would be the cheapest option of all for me since fee of public universities is dirt cheap for Turkey citizens. But that wasn't ans still isn't an option for me due to political problems in Turkey.

So, I went to India. Started my university education there. I could continue for only 1,5 years. Collected my transcription. I moved to Kyrgyzstan after staying almost 2 years in India. Are you wondering what I did in ~6 months timeframe I wasn't going to uni but still in India? Well, I looked for a reason to remain living.

Life was more beatiful. Instead of writting code on the paper, we would design and write our own code during the exam. Once again we were learning and not just memorizing. But not everything was exquisite. Having bad foundation bitten me this time. I can't understand when lecturer talks in „èí, ‚ÖÄ, ‚à´, ‚àÇ or in any other Greek letter. Sorry to say it but my mathematics is limited to ‚à™, +-*/=‚â†, \< \>, ? and x.  

"What about the foundation you built in Kenya?" you may ask. Well, I left after AS-level and didn't continue to A-level. And „èí and ‚à´ are IGCSE A-level topics, it turns out.

I didn't talk about mathematics classes in India because, well, uhm ... I dunno. There was a table we had to memorize. A big table full of numbers. I don't know how but I passed statistics in India. It is not difficult. It is just a terrible terrible pain and I was happy to get rid of it. Passing statistics without learning anything was a reward since learning doesn't happen in Indian university AFAIK. You get loaded with theory and doomed to forget.



This is a story of frustration with theory heavy education system.


I was born in Turkey and I grew up there. I studied elementary school and half of the  
Turkey's education system prioritizes theory big time. People were not happy about it when I was living in Turkey and still think that not much changed.  
Ministry of Education changed examination systems multiple times, not the education system. In fact some may think that ministry of education has killed so many examination systems that it probably is competing Google at this point. 

I like computers. Flash games of web back in the days are somewhat responsible for this.  
Magic like nature of computers that turns *electrons* flowing through wires into *games* into *images* into *chemical of fun* inside of my brain really fascinated me.  

My family and I moved abroad and we started learning English language.


I have an interest towards computers. There always was a computer in our house and pretty limited internet in our house. this is why I persuade Computer Science degree when people said that I need a diploma to exist.
