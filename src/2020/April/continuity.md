# Continuity

is difficult. I always had issues with starting to something then continue to do it. Either I am bad at keeping interest at something or I don't know the difference between interest and hype. Sometimes it feels like I am battling myself just to finish what I once deeply wanted to start. 

Unfortunatly I am not the only one. Take GitHub as an example. It is a graveyard of personal projects.

Take this very post as another example. I am writing this just to get it out of my virtual list of "Must writes".

  

Sometimes I blame it on life. Life is like a boat drifting in ocean. There are thunders that will move you up and down to bring you to foreign land overnight. And then there are calm waters that still moves you but you don't notice it. You think you are stationary until you trip over and almost fall into the water, because you hit a rock that was at the horizon at some point.

I feel like I am in calm waters. Because it looks like I am just staying at home and I got all the time in the world to do whatever I want. I start doing whatever it is I wanted to do. Then something hits me. I just lose interest and start to my "project that will be Legen...dary". Finally the projects I started but never finished are a burden that I can't take anymore and I have no idea what to do next. Remember, I am kid in his early adulthood. So, I am pretty new in this life. I don't know what I want or should want from life.

  

This is not an article about guide on how to cope with such cases. This is a call for help. I accepted "Smart people learn from their mistakes, genius people learn from others' mistakes." as my motto. I am not saying that share your insecurities with me. I just want to learn life before it happens.

PS: I wanted to start to [100 Days To Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/) with everyone else on 25 Apr 2020. But didn't start for that very reason. I am scared to not continue. In DM please don't tell me why I should write #100DaysToOffload.
