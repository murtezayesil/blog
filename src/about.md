### I use FOSS
Not only FOSS, but for the most part.
I use Elementary and Manjaro distros on my PC and Lineage OS on my phone.

### I like computers
I was a tinkerer kind since childhood. While my brother was playing Minecraft, I was in look for mods.
Games pulled me to computers, mods pulled me to programming. Even though I never wrote a mod for any game, ability to turn these fancy pile of metals (computers) to something useful attracted me to computer programming.
