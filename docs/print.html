<p>I am learning <a href="httpd://www.rust-lang.org">Rust Programming Language</a>. Its way of taking care of data helps developers avoid many problems in the future.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#srcsquarers" id="srcsquarers">src/square.rs</a></h4>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused_variables)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>pub fn square_of( number:i32 ) -&gt; i32 {
    number * number
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h4><a class="header" href="#srcmainrs" id="srcmainrs">src/main.rs</a></h4>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">//  add square.rs as a MODule
//  mod PATH_TO_FILE (without .rs extension) ;
mod square;

fn main() {
    let number = 4;
    println!(&quot;Square of {} is {}&quot;, number, square::square_of(number) );
    // Whenever we want to use a function from an imported module
    //, we have to move scope to that module using :: operator
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program will <em>import</em> <code>square.rs</code> module in <code>square</code> scope. But there is a catch, whatever variable/function we want to access from outside must be declared as PUBlic in the module.
If a variable/function is only being used within the scope, then there is no need of making that variable/function public.</p>
<hr />
<p>Until today, I have been writing all the code for a program into main.rs file, main source file for Rust.<br />
The problems with this strategy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>code becomes hard to read and fix.</li>
<li>computer takes longer to compile ü§îÔ∏è <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></li>
<li>seeing unrelated code, of other functions, can break focus. (This may sound like a none-sense, but I lose focus easily)</li>
</ul>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Server powering this blog has no Rust Compiler installed. You will get error if you try to run the code from the browser.<br />
If you have rust compiler on your computer, feel free to clone <code>https://github.com/murtezayesil/blog.git</code>.
After clonning, you can compile and run example by running <code>rustc main.rs; ./main</code> command at blog/src/TIL/13.03.2020/</p>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Code segment for <code>square.rs</code> has a hiddenline toggle. I didn't write the code that is surronding the <code>square_of()</code> function but was generated by the mdBook. Because it sees missing main as a problem.</p>
<p><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>: Not always but parallel compiling should benefit from this. While making this claim I want to point out that I DO NOT know how Rust compiler handles parallel compiling. But it is a good practice none-the-less.</p>

<p>Why is it called &quot;Not very FAQ&quot;? </summary></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have recently started blogging and wanted to try mdBook's capabilities by writing an FAQ page. In case people get questions about this blog, I want some of them are be pre-answered.</p>

<p>This blog looks great üôÇÔ∏è Which CMS and theme do you use?</p>

<p>Not powered by a CMS. This page is built using <em><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/mdbook">mdBook</a>.</em></p>

<details>
    <summary> Why use <b>mdBook</b>, an online book creation tool, while there are CMSs that specializes on Blogging ? </summary>
    <p>
        1. CMSs are overkill for my needs
    </p>
    <p>
        2. I don't want to run a software that will require updating time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. I <b>feel</b> like CMSs are vendor locking in some way. Many of them require creating account to use their tools. I am not saying that is not fair, it is their platform after all. I don't want one more online account for something I don't need.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. CMSs usually embed "innocent" trackers to count visits. I don't care about how many people read my articles. I would rather have meaningful conversation in social media than seeing visitor numbers go up.
